          be a bit much), I've picked out some better ones for this list,
          attaching links and some context. Sometimes it's hard to know what to
          say or if I should at all, so I'll let music try and speak for me.

            <span className="font-bold underline">Dusk in Her Embrace</span>, ah
            Cradle of Filth, easily one of my favorite bands. I've always found
            their lyrical content to be very poetic. Which leaves room for
            interpretation. For me, this song speaks to three aspects of love
            that together represent an absolute love. The "real" love, to love
            the person's soul. The sexual love, to love the person's flesh. The
            eternal love, to love the person unconditionally to no end.
